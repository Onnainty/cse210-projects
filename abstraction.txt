By Damian Onnainty:

Abstraction in programming is a style in which complex ideas are simplified 
by focusing programming only on the essential aspects and leaving out unnecessary
details. This approach is essential for creating scalable and maintainable systems 
by effectively managing complexity, increasing productivity, and encouraging 
reusable and understandable code. Furthermore, by allowing developers to focus 
on problem solving rather than specific aspects of the implementation, abstraction 
supports sophisticated software development. For example, in object-oriented programming, 
classes abstract the inner workings of objects, exposing essential methods and properties. 
Similarly, libraries and frameworks offer higher-level abstractions, simplifying tasks such as 
database interactions and user interface management across software development projects.
